Density Functional Theory (DFT) Based
#####################################

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem assures us that a system’s ground-state electron density contains all
the information necessary to compute all of its observable properties.
Moreover, the mathematical framework of density-functional theory (DFT) provides a rich framework
for deriving chemically intuitive concepts to compute conceptual properties of chemical systems,
even though those properties are rarely observable.

Unlike the framework of conceptual DFT (which is focused on reactivity), the DFT-based descriptive
tools are primarily used to elucidate molecule's electronic structure and binding, though some
of them are relevant to chemical reactivity as well.
At the most fundamental level, the electron density and its derivatives are of the most fundamental
importance.
At the next level, various energetic quantities associated with DFT have a leading role; these
include the electrostatic potential, the kinetic energy density and various approximations thereto,
etc. Suitably chosen linear combinations of these quantities have proven conceptual significance,
as do several of the “intermediate quantities” that are commonly used in developing new density
functionals in DFT.

 .. Note::
    DFT-based tools can be computed in a spin resolved or non-spin resolved manner. Specifically,
    you can initialize the DFTBased class with `spin="a"`, `spin="b"`, `spin="s"`, or `spin="ab"`
    to use :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta`, :math:`\alpha - \beta` or :math:`\alpha + \beta` electron
    density, respectively. For simplicity, we do not specify the spin in mathematical formulas that
    follows.
