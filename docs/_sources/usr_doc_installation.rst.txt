Installation
############

Supported System
================
ChemTools is available on ``Linux`` and ``MacOS`` with ``Python 2.7``.
In the future release, we will support ``Windows 10`` and ``Python 3.6+``.


Source Code
===========

The latest code can be obtained through Github (private at present),

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/theochem/chemtools.git chemtools


.. _usr_py_depend:

Dependencies
============

The following dependencies will be necessary for ChemTools to build properly,

* Python >= 2.7, < 3.0: http://www.python.org/ (Also install development files.)
* PIP >= 7.0: https://pip.pypa.io/ (Not required in some scenarios but never bad to have.)
* SciPy >= 0.11.0: http://www.scipy.org/
* NumPy >= 1.9.1: http://www.numpy.org/
* SymPy >= 0.7.1: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/
* Matplotlib >= 1.0: http://matplotlib.org/
* Nosetests >= 1.1.2: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/
* HORTON >= 2.0.1: http://theochem.github.io/horton/2.0.1/index.html
* Git-LFS >= 2.0.1: https://git-lfs.github.com/

See :ref:`Documentation Dependencies <usr_doc>` for the dependencies
required for building the documentations.
All dependencies are recommanded to install through Conda.

Conda
~~~~~
For ``Linux`` and ``MacOS`` users, you can download
`miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ to manage the
dependencies. Either version (2.7 or 3.7) will work.

To activate conda base in system:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda activate

To create a virtual environment for ChemTools:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create -n chemtools python=2.7

To activate ``ChemTools`` virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda activate chemtools

To install HORTON and Git-LFS:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c theochem horton
    $ conda install git-lfs

To deactivate the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda deactivate


Installation
============
Before installing ChemTools, make sure you are in the ``chemtools`` conda
environment. To install ChemTools to your system, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install .

Or, to install ChemTools inplace as an editable package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e .

.. _usr_testing:

Testing
=======

To ensure that all the parts of ChemTools working properly, nosetests can be used to run ChemTool's
automatic tests:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ nosetests -v chemtools

At this stage, some ``UserWarning`` messages are printed in between tests which is expected.
However, no test should fail.

Uninstallation
==============

To remove ChemTools from your system, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip uninstall chemtools

Intro to VMD
============

Go to `VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD>`_ ,
select the link based on your system OS. Then you will be brought to the registration
page. Shortly after it's done, install the download file to the proper position on your laptop.

For ``macOS`` and ``Linux`` user, you can add the path to your bash profile
(``.bashrc`` on **Linux**, or ``.bash_profile`` on **macOS**) at your home directory
for quick access if it's not on your path.

.. code-block:: bash

    alias vmd="The/path/to/vmd/command/in/your/system"

Usages
~~~~~~

* To visualize in ``VMD``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vmd -e script.vmd

* To save the state, you can click ``File`` > ``Save Visualizaiton State``.
* If you'd like to save the picture during the visualization,
  you can click ``File`` > ``Render`` > ``Filename`` > ``Start Rendering``
