ChemTools |version|
###################

ChemTools is a free and open source Python library for interpreting the results of
quantum chemistry calculations. The goal of ChemTools is to provide a toolbox by which
the quantitative output of electronic structure theory calculations can be expressed in
chemical language. ChemTools provides easy-to-use core functionality to compute fundamental
descriptors of conceptual quantum chemistry, together with a flexible set
of utilities allowing scientists to easily test their own discoveries.
ChemTools is designed as a module of the `HORTON package <http://theochem.github.io/horton/>`_,
but can also be used independently to post-process output files of many standard quantum chemistry programs.

Motivated by our interests and our assessment of which portions of the conceptual quantum
chemistry community are most underserved, the current version of ChemTools emphasizes on
conceptual tools associated with, or at least inspired by, density-functional theory (DFT)
and density-matrix theory.
Future developments will include orbital-based tools, information-theoretic methods, and various types
of population and bonding analysis, and quantum chemical topology (including the quantum theory
of atoms in molecules, QTAIM). We also aim to make it easier for theorists to test, implement, and disseminate
new ideas, and to help non-specialists use the most powerful and most recent tools from conceptual
quantum chemistry.
